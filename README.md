## Description
Bugs Game is a simulation game where players can interact with different types of bugs that move around a board. The game has a text-based interface that allows players to perform various actions such as displaying all the bugs on the board, finding a bug by ID, tapping the bug board to make all bugs move, displaying the life history of all bugs, and displaying all cells and their bugs. The game also has a graphics interface that allows players to see the bugs move around the board and interact with them using the mouse and arrow keys.

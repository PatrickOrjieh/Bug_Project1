//A Crawler bug moves according to these rules:
//- moves by 1 unit in the direction it is currently facing
//- if at edge of board and canâ€™t move in current direction (because
//its way is blocked), then, set a new direction at random. (Repeat
//until bug can move forward). - record new position in the crawler's path history
//move function
//void move(){}
